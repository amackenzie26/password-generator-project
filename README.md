# Password Generator Project

## Description

For this project I was assigned to take existing HTML and CSS documents and write the code for a Javascript file that creates functionality for a password generator. My parameters were to allow the user to select between 8-128 characters, uppercase characters, lowecase characters, numbers, and symbols to be incorporated into the random password to be generated upon the clicking of a button.
